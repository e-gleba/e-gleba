### About me
Hello there! My name is Eugene, and I'm a devops engineer and computer science enthusiast with a passion for electronics. Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from decoding satellite data to modding video games.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a keen eye for design and a passion for creating intuitive user interfaces. I believe that a well-designed UI can make all the difference in the user experience, and I always strive to create software that is both functional and visually appealing.
